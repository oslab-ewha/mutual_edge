# Minimal Hyperledger Fabric Network for Mutual Edge Mileage Demo

This repository provides a minimal Hyperledger Fabric network (1 Org, 1 Peer, 1 Orderer)
to demonstrate the mileage-based trust model described in our Mutual Edge paper.
The network allows deploying a simple chaincode (`mileage_cc.go`) that supports
earning and consuming mileage credits between enterprises.

This example is intentionally lightweight and focuses on conceptual clarity.
It is suitable as a reproducible artifact for academic reviewers.
